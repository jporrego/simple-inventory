# Caf√©Shop - _Full Stack E-commerce Portfolio Project_

It consists of two **React** sites (a simple **Shop** for clients and an **Admin Dashboard** for managing the inventory and doing CRUD operations) and a **Node Backend**.

## Shop

_React - Typescript_

- [Live Site](https://jporrego.github.io/coffee-shop/)
- [Repo](https://github.com/jporrego/coffee-shop)

## Admin Dashboard

_React - Typescript_

- [Live Site](https://coffee-shop-admin-dashboard.netlify.app/)

## Backend

_Node - Express - MongoDB_

- [Repo](https://github.com/jporrego/simple-inventory)

## Notes

- User registration is not implemented to make it easier for everyone to try the websites.
- Everytime the backend is started, it runs a script to delete everything from the database and repopulate it with clean information.
- The backend is hosted on Heroku's free tier, so the products can take around ten seconds to load the first time if the backend has been inactive for a while.
