## Backend

_Node - Express - MongoDB_

- [Repo](https://github.com/jporrego/simple-inventory)

## Notes

- User registration is not implemented to make it easier for everyone to try the websites.
- Everytime the backend is started, it runs a script to delete everything from the database and repopulate it with clean information.
- The backend is hosted on Heroku's free tier, so the products can take around ten seconds to load the first time if the backend has been inactive for a while.
